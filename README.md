To Run the back end we need to start rabbitmq server and then celery to make the API asynchronous and then run the Django server using the commands below:

```bash
celery -A newsX_backend worker -l info
python manage.py runserver
```

Make sure that RabbitMQ is running before starting celery.

# [FrontEnd:](https://2vid.tech/)

The Front end is connected to the backend via a google form. Once a user submits the google form it triggers a event in **ZAPIER** which then calls a webhook we have connected Zapier to, Then the video get’s made and is then sent to the users mail id using which he/she has filled the form. 

The google form is wrapped in a nice frontend template to give any new users an idea as to what services we provide and what they can expect from out website. 

**[Please visit our website](https://2vid.tech/)** 

The Code for the front end is in the folder **2vid_landing_page**
