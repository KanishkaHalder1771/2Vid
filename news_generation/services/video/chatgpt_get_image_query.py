The queries should be for relevant images or videos describing the article, given in contextual order.
The Image queries are for google search so they can be descriptive, about 3 to 6 words.
But the video queries should be very generic, it should not contain any named entities or proper nouns, the video query is for stock video search platforms and should contain generic terms only. The video queries should br strictly one worded. If the video query becomes more than 1 word then replace it with the most suitable topic of 1 word, do not worry about context.
Now, Along with all the queries, give a list of exactly 4 similar words of that query and add '|' as separator between the query and the list of similar words and use ',' as delimiter for the list of similar words
The query and list of similar words are two different entities, the specifications for the query is not applicable on the list of similar words.
Remember the Video query should be exactly 1 word.
